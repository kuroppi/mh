We can't believe the amount of growth we've seen in our son since he's been going here. He's like a totally different kid and it's only been a couple of months!

System 4 Curriculum
------------------------------
Social
Learning how to interact with both adults and peers is a cornerstone of our social development goals for each child. Many opportunities for interaction to occur in a natural manner are made available both in and out of the classroom. 

Emotional
Controlling emotions and maintaining a stable disposition is one of the hardest behavioral adjustments a child can make during this phase of growth. We have highly educated and experienced staff using proven methods to gently shepherd your child through this delicate stage

Educational
Whether at play or in-class, the learning never ends. Carefully planned topics and lessons are prepared well in advance and made available each quarter. Introductory curriculum to Reading, Writing, Math, Science, History, and Art are crafted to instill a life-long love of learning.

Physical
We have dedicated over 50% of the Magic Hours campus towards outdoor educational programs that promote physical development. The grounds and equipment have recieved the highest safety rating by all regulating agencies. Not all physical development occurs outdoors. The critical stage of fine-tuning motor skills that include balance, agility, and manual dexterity are met head on with the generous availability of  Legos, Kinex, building blocks, and group games
