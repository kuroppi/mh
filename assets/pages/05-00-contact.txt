We are happy to accomodate any Parents/Guardians who wish to tour the school facilities prior to enrollment. Tours are guided and can be conducted during operating hours. This provides an opportunity to observe students and teachers in a real-time setting. Tours are generally given to no more than 4 adults in a party. In order to avoid distractions and disruptions, tours are for adults only.
