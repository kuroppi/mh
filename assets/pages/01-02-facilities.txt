Facilities

Location
-------------------------------------------------
Located in a quiet neighborhood setting of San Diego's Mira Mesa community, the Magic Hours campus provides easy access and drop-off/pick-up options for parents. Many nearby residents find the short drive convenient. For others, it is well within walking distance.

Situated within a residential area, there are convenient store and shopping amenities nearby.


Classrooms
-------------------------------------------------
There are 3 main classrooms that are utilized to maintain healthy degrees of separation among the various age groups. They are strategically planned out to allow simultaneous times of productivity, creativity, and rest.

Be sure to have a look at our calendar to view the daily agenda for each of the rooms.


Playground
-------------------------------------------------
The spacious outdoor playground is roughly half of the entire campus.  We incorporate vibrant colors into all of our newer, state-of-the-art equipment to promote fun and safety.

The mild San Diego micro-climate is ideal for outdoor play, learning, and exploration throughout much of the year. The surrounding greenery provides a park-like setting while acting as a buffer from external elements.

I love the fact that my daughter spends a good amount of time playing outside. It really helps her sleep well at night.
